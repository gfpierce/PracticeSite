<!-- Hello to anyone reading this! I built this site in its current state was entirely on my own. In the span of 36 hours, I went from having absolutely no experience with HTML to building this website as you see it now. I will be continually expanding on the site as my skills grown. The CSS code for this site can be found at https://github.com/gfpierce/gfpierce.github.io/blob/master/style.css. Thanks for reading through! - Garrett Pierce, 9/3/2017 -->

        <h1>About Me</h1>   
        <p>As you've probably surmised by now, my name is Garrett Pierce. I'm an aspiring web developer, software engineer, and musician. My work thus far is strictly in HTML and CSS, but I plan to expand my skills to include vanilla JavaScript, the frameworks AngularJS and ReactJS, mySQL, and Node.js. I'm also familiar with version control using Git.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I've also been known to play around in Java, C++, and Python, and I hope to learn Ruby and Ruby on Rails someday soon. As a dedicated Android user, I want to get into Android app development down the line.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I'm currently working on my bachelor's degree in software engineering. It is a goal of mine to one day earn a master's degree in Human-Computer Interaction.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I also create music under the name URSA MAJOR. Learn more below.</p>

    <div id="projects">
        <h1>Projects</h1>
        <p>In the future, I'll be sharing some of my projects here. Right now, the only project I have to share is the site you're currently reading.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="music">
        <h1>Music</h1>
        <p>In addition to all of my web and software development work, I create music on the side under the name URSA MAJOR. Music has been a creative outlet of mine for most of my life. I sing, play guitar, bass, drums, piano, harmonica, and banjo. I rarely do more than two of those at the same time.</p>
