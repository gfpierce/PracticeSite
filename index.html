    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>Hello! Thanks for visiting my webpage!</h2>
    <p>As you've probably surmised by now, my name is Garrett Pierce. I'm an aspiring web developer, software engineer, and musician. I'm currently attending school to earn a bachelor's degree in software engineering. My work thus far is strictly in HTML and CSS, but I plan to expand my skills to include vanilla JavaScript, the frameworks AngularJS and ReactJS, mySQL, and Node.js.</p>
    </ br>
    </ br>
    <p>I've also been known to play around in Java, C++, and Python, and I hope to learn Ruby and Ruby on Rails someday soon. I'm also familiar with version control using Git.</p>
    </ br>
    </ br>
    <p>In addition, I'm also a musician, and have an ambient project called URSA MAJOR. Visit my <a href="music.html">music page</a> to learn more.</p>
